# Inventory-Management-System

**Overview**
This repository hosts a small-scale inventory management system developed in C++ as a school assignment. The system currently enables basic inventory operations like addition, removal, updating, and display of items.

**Purpose**
Initially conceived as a compact project for academic purposes, the aim is to expand this system into a more comprehensive and user-friendly solution.

**Planned Expansion**
_GUI Implementation:_ A graphical user interface (GUI) will be integrated to enhance usability and accessibility for users.
_Functionality Expansion:_ The intent is to broaden the capabilities by adding features like search, sorting, and statistical analysis tools.
_Scalability:_ Design enhancements and code optimizations will be made to accommodate larger datasets and improve overall system performance.
